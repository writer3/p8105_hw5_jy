## Problem 1

Write a function that, for a fixed group size, randomly draws “birthdays” for each person; checks whether there are duplicate birthdays in the group; and returns TRUE or FALSE based on the result.

If you put n = 10, 30, etc people into a room,
what is the probability that at least 2 have the same birthday?

```{r}
bday_sim = function(n) {
  
  bdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  
  duplicate = length(unique(bdays)) < n #check for any duplicates, and FALSE if <n
  
  return(duplicate)
  
}

bday_sim(30)

```
